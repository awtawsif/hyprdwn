# This file contains rules for specific windows.
# You can use these rules to set properties like floating, opacity, and size for individual windows.

# Example windowrule
# windowrule = float,class:^(kitty)$,title:^(kitty)$

# Ignore maximize requests from apps. You'll probably like this.
windowrule = suppressevent maximize, class:.*

# Fix some dragging issues with XWayland
windowrule = nofocus,class:^$,title:^$,xwayland:1,floating:1,fullscreen:0,pinned:0
