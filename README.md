## üöÄ Installation

Setting up your Hyprland environment is simple. The `setup.sh` script handles everything for you.

**Prerequisites:**
*   A fresh Arch Linux installation. This setup is designed for a **clean Arch Linux installation**. For best results, start with a minimal installation that does not include a desktop environment. If you are using the `archinstall` script, select the **'minimal' profile** to ensure there are no conflicting configurations.
*   `git` installed (`sudo pacman -S git`).

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/awtawsif/hyprdwn.git
    cd hyprdwn
    ```

2.  **Make the scripts executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x setup.sh install_packages.sh
    ```

3.  **Run the setup script:**
    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```

The script will:
-   Install `yay` (an AUR helper) if it's not already present.
-   Use `pacman` and `yay` to install all the necessary packages listed in `install_packages.sh`.
-   Back up your existing `.config` directory to `~/.config.bak.<timestamp>`.
-   Copy all the configuration files to your `~/.config` directory.
-   Set up your home directory with standard user folders.
-   Enable the `ly` display manager.

After the script finishes, reboot your system, and you should be greeted by the Ly login screen.
